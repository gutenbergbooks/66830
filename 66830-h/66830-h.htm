in the pages
of <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own
Paper</span> a writer has
explained the laws of
form governing and
underlying what we
call “classical” music. To those who love
art, in whatever guise it comes to us—as
symphony, picture, or poem—a very slight
amount of careful study of its accepted laws
will repay a thousandfold the trouble taken.
Having grasped even the faintest idea of
the reason for the special shape of a sonata
or a sonnet, the interest in the work itself
becomes more keen. Then, too, it will be
seen why literary men and artists choose the
higher forms of their art to clothe their
ideas. There is too often a feeling that
the chief difference between popular and
classical art is that the one is “dry,” while
the other is pleasing. This is in part true,
but only when scholastic rules are obtruded
too prominently. For while it may be at
once conceded that too great an attention
to form produces dry bones, yet genius can
make these live, for subject as they are to laws,
and having clear sequence of form, they have
inherent vitality and strength, relying on more
than mere fashion to keep their hold on the
people, in spite of the varying taste of each
passing year.</p>

<p>Nature, to whom we all come alike for our
simplest as our highest thoughts, works in
many ways, but all subject to inviolable laws.
These may often be not evident at a cursory
glance, and still more often beyond our
keenest search; we can only infer the law from
the result. In mere human work, what one
man produces is more or less easily understood
by his fellow-man, and a knowledge of the
rules to which he conformed, adds interest to
our pleasure in his work, and makes us able to
be real critics, to some extent, while mere taste
or feeling can lay claim to no more than a
personal and often valueless opinion.</p>

<p>The laws which govern music are probably
better known than those which rule verse, as
our English poets choose generally a freer and
more flexible mode of expression than the old
writers allowed. Again, in music the form is
more easily seen, for two reasons: one, that
constant habit of hearing pieces in strict form
has given us knowledge, without our being
able to formulate it; the other, that the subjects
of music, being at most vague and abstract,
are left out of the title of works by the
great masters, save in a very few instances.
Even the “Eroica Symphony” or the “Wedding
March” merely suggests abstract feelings.
To describe a rose or an umbrella, for
example, is impossible in music. We can only
suggest praise, or grief, and similar emotional
feelings. Therefore the shape only is usually
given in the title, such as a march, minuet, or
sonata. But in poetry the shape is rarely described.
Even in the most widely used of
these fixed forms, the sonnet, the shape is
not by any means invariably expressed in the
title. In the verses written in imitation of the
Old French Troubadours it is more often
used. In the <i>rondeau</i>, the most widely chosen,
it is not always given, but the <i>triolet</i>, <i>villanelle</i>,
or <i>ballade</i> is almost always so described
in the title, the shape, as in music, ranking
worthy of interest in itself. These old shapes
are more akin to the fugue and canon in
music, as the whole work has inner laws
governing each detail, and making the choice
of words or notes decided beforehand to a
great extent by the form.</p>

<p>It is intended in this paper to describe a few
of the forms which have of late found favour
with the younger school of living poets, for a
twofold reason: first, that their readers may
better appreciate their works; secondly, that
the amateur verse-writer may gain a knowledge
of these verse shapes, and thereby be
able to produce trifles which are worthy of
attention. Although it is not given to many
to produce great thoughts, yet to acquire a
polished mode of displaying lesser ones to
advantage, is in itself worth the trying. The
tendency to diffusiveness which weakens so
much verse, until the pretty trifling becomes
wearisome, would be lessened if a strict form
were first chosen, and the subject necessarily
compressed within its limits.</p>

<p>The greater number of these forms originated
with the Troubadours, and here, for mere
brevity’s sake, only a very few words must be
said. The subject of their loves and their
lives has been so fully discussed that a mere
<i>résumé</i> of all that is known would fill many
parts of this magazine. Hallam says “the
earliest records cannot trace them beyond
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1100, and they became extinct at the end
of the next century. While they flourished
they numbered many hundreds of versifiers
in the language of Provence, though not
always natives of France.” It would be
interesting, if space allowed, to quote from
some of the many histories. I had intended to
do so, but the growing material forbade the
idea of using it here, and so I must refer
would-be inquirers to some of the more easily
accessible works. Foremost is Dr. Francis
Hueffer’s “The Troubadours,” published in
1878; it gives a scholarly and full account of
the most salient members of the school and
their works. “The Troubadours: their Loves
and Lives,” by Mr. John Rutherford, is also
interesting; while a work by M. Theodore de
Banville, the “Petit Traité de Poésie
Française,” affords an exhaustive analysis of
the rules of their verse and its modern imitations.</p>

<p>Their verse was distinguished by its being
subject to very strict and subtle laws, often
involved and carried to an artificial complexity,
perilously near the triumph of sound over
sense; yet it has a charm peculiarly its own.
The forms of this school being still exotic, and
not (except the sonnet) incorporated into
English literature, gives them a special fitness
when employed for fanciful trifles on subjects
of an older time.</p>

<p>The qualities termed “conceits” by the
old English writers, are admirably expressed
through the medium of these old shapes; a
certain amount of extravagance of compliment
and affectation is not out of place here. The
flavour of the verse smacks of the
“Moyen Age,” or “Powder and Fan”
period beloved by artists. In these forms the
shape of the verse itself takes the place somewhat
of the costume and accessories of a
painting, and gives local colour to the subject.
When used in this way, as Mr. Austin
Dobson has so often shown, they can be made
(like a picture by Abbey) to reproduce the past
in a living way, with its own domestic
sentiment, far removed from a mere
archæological or academic study of olden days,
which often appeals to the intellect rather
than the feeling, and moves us to criticise the
method employed, instead of falling under the
charm of the subject described.</p>

<p>But they are by no means limited to this
class of subject, as Mr. Swinburne’s Roundels
show. Nature and her moods may be sung
as fitly in these, as in the most free forms of
poetry.</p>

<p>Many estimable but badly-informed people
think that poetry or verse (unluckily these
terms are synonymous to them) is either a
divine outburst of feeling, expressing itself
almost spontaneously in rhyme, or, sad to say,
a mere vehicle to hide the poverty of ideas,
and eke out a repetition of fancies intolerable
in prose. The multitude are slow to
realise law in any shape, and in art no less
than nature look upon most results as the
effect of what a critic has termed “the
glorious gospel of haphazard.” To these
poetry suggests no art in itself, only a more or
less musical jingle of pretty sounds, gay or
plaintive feelings, while the whole is unreal
and fantastic.</p>

<p>But to avoid further preface, let us take a
specimen of the aforementioned forms, choosing
a dainty little epigrammatic verse known
as the <i>Triolet</i>, to start with. This form, complete
always in eight short lines, is peculiarly
a product of the old French school of verse,
and is in itself, to some extent, an epitome of
all the rest. Almost new in English poetry,
the first examples dating from a volume of
poems published in 1873 by Mr. Bridges, it
has yet won many friends, although, so far as
diligent search by the present writer has been
able to trace them, a selection of the best would
fill but a few pages of this paper.</p>

<p>Flexible only in the rhythm and length of
its lines, which are generally about six feet
(syllabic feet, of course) in length, it is stern,
and forbids tampering in all other respects,
allowing but two rhyme-sounds for the whole
of the lines. The lines themselves are repeated
in a certain unalterable order; the
first two serve again for the seventh and
eighth, while the fourth is also a repetition of
the first; no syllable even, in the best examples,
is changed in these lines. But on
each fresh appearance the words should, if
possible, convey a fresh phase of the idea, the
emphasis alone serving to mark the distinction.
On studying the examples given, it will
be found that the crux lies in the treatment of
the fifth and sixth lines, while the way the
third is connected with the fourth, and the
neatness with which the final couplet is repeated
to form a necessary part of the whole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">{355}</span>
and not a mere repeat to fill up the prescribed
form, is almost as difficult. The following
example is a very perfect one; it comes in a
sequence of triolets by Mr. Austin Dobson,
entitled “Rose Leaves.” The first version
ran:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I intended an ode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it turned into triolets.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It began <i>à la mode</i>:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I intended an ode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Rose crossed the road</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With a bunch of fresh violets;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I intended an ode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it turned into triolets.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This has a literary interest apart from its own
merits, as the critics, on its first introduction,
blamed Mr. Dobson severely for attempting
to english the word triolet. “Suppose an
audacious person were to extend the license,
and introduce cabriolet as a thirdsman?” said
<i>The Academy</i>, on June 23, 1877. In spite
of Mr. W. S. Gilbert, in <i>Princess Ida</i>, trying
also to rhyme it to violet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, dainty triolet! oh, fragrant violet! oh, gentle heigho-let! (or little sigh)”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the word remains French; and in a later
version Mr. Dobson has re-cast the poem.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I intended an ode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it turned to a sonnet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I began <i>à la mode</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I intended an ode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Rose crossed the road</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In her latest new bonnet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I intended an ode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it turned to a sonnet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This may be better rhyme, but the <i>raison
d’être</i> is gone; it has not turned to a sonnet,
but is still a triolet.</p>

<p>To understand the form more clearly, it is
best to take one and dissect it, thereby showing
its structure. To avoid mutilating a master’s
work, and possibly misinterpreting it, I
will take one in my possession, not yet published,
printing it, not as it would be, but
displayed (to use a technical term), thereby
exaggerating the emphasis with which the
writer intended it should be read.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here we see the whole is a soliloquy in the
historic present tense. The first two lines
explain the incident, the third the speaker’s
own comment on it, noting in the fourth how
it differs from his own opinion. In the fifth
he meditates on the reason which has affected
him. In the sixth he wavers between insincerity
and politeness or truth and the chance
of conveying a sense of unfriendliness; while
in the last he concludes that it is a fact they
differ, and, still undecided in action, wishes
the reason had not existed so that he might
sincerely agree with the supposed Primrose
lady, and avoid feigning a political acquiescence
of opinion. So trifling an incident will not
bear analysis on its own merits, and is merely
dwelt on to explain the structure of the verse.</p>

<p>A triolet should be complete in itself. In a
very able article in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>
(July, 1877) Mr. E. W. Gosse points out the
danger of a fascinating tendency to connect a
sequence of triolets. The constant recurrence
of the lines would soon become fatally
monotonous. One or two at the most are
bearable.</p>

<p>A typical pair appeared in a number of
<i>The Century</i> (January, 1883). Thoroughly
American, they show well, first the half-bantering,
half-real feeling of the poet, artificial in
expression, yet not altogether untrue, while
her answer shows the American girl pure and
simple, the conventional courtesy of the first
being happily balanced by the naïve frankness
of the second.</p>

<p>If space allowed there are other dainty
flowerets to be culled from this bunch of
French exotics, which seem to be cultivated
more in America than at home at present.
None of our greater poets has, I think,
published a triolet. The influence of this form
is seen in Mr. Swinburne’s oft-quoted poem,
“A Match” (If love were what the rose is);
and Longfellow has an evident translation of
one, although he has not followed strictly the
peculiar repetition of the lines.</p>

<p>But many of our younger poets have published
triolets. Mr. Austin Dobson is <i>facile
princeps</i> in this form (as indeed in nearly all
these Provençal rhythms), while Mr. John Payne
and Mr. Andrew Lang rarely if ever use it,
although rondeaux and ballades are very frequent
in their volumes. Miss Pfeiffer has
used it once. Miss A. Mary F. Robinson has
a very charming triolet sequence “Fiametta,”
which almost reconciles one to the connected
triolet. But two or three variations from the
strict form, while relieving the monotony of the
poem, prove yet more strongly the truth of the
warning given by Mr. Gosse. Miss May
Probyn in her volume a “Ballad of the
Road,” has several good specimens, and here
and there among periodical literature sufficient
are to be found to warrant a hope that the
dainty little epigrammatic verse may yet pass
into accepted currency, and supply for epigram
or pretty trifling fancies the place the sonnet
has acquired for the presentation of stately
images and profound thought. While the
very care with which the accepted form may
be filled up appears at first sight to augur
great popularity, probably that very reason
has made writers more cautious in using it,
since it can be so quickly abused and made
unbearable doggerel, unless the recurring lines
have a reasonable pretext for their repetition.
Finally, a word of advice to those who attempt
a triolet. Choose a slight, fanciful incident;
let the rhymes be exact and easy; and be
content with the “suggestion” (which, like a
clever sketch) it gives of some trivial event or
idea, avoiding complex subjects or too deep
thoughts, for which the form is not well
suited.</p>

one ills—the word
“one” signifying
“all the rest”—that
afflict humanity,
young and old, by
far the larger proportion
are what
may be called
chronic troubles.
And I do not refer
to any particular
or decided form of illness, but when I say
“chronic,” I mean the term to relate to
people who are seldom overwell, who are
easily tired, subject to fits of low spirits, have
but small inclination for the exercise which
they know they need, who have at times no
pleasure in other folks’ society, and none in
their own, whose stomachs are easily put out
of order, who do not always sleep as well as
they would wish to, whose systems are dry and
irregular generally, who suffer at times from
headache, at times from backache, and at
times from aches all over.</p>

<p>What a tremendously long sentence I have
just written! It almost frightens me to look
back at it. Well, this class of complainers—for
if they do not complain to others they do
so to themselves quietly, and have fancies
that all the world is heartless and cold, and a
dozen other things that “it didn’t houghter to
be,” as the old charwoman said—this class, I
say, are nearly always work-a-day girls; I do
not refer altogether to manual labour, but to
businesses that necessitate a good deal of
mental thought and calculation. But many
belong also to this class, who have nothing at
all to do, and whose minds might be said to
be preying on their constitutions.</p>

<p>Well, at all events, there they are, these
chronically poorly people. They will not admit
that there is anything very much the matter
with them, but at the same time no class of
sufferers have a sharper eye for the advertisement
of some infallible nostrum, that is going
to banish sickness from this world entirely, or
a sharper ear to listen to any suggested
remedy, no matter who it is that recommends
it. It may be an old wife’s cure. That does
not signify; they simply console themselves
with the belief that old wives often know a
deal more than doctors, and swallow the compound.</p>

<p>Now let me tell this class of invalids: I. That
medicines are probably not wanted at all in
such complaints as theirs. II. That medicine
of any kind often does more harm than good.
III. That it is folly to think or believe that a
complaint which has lasted perhaps months,
can be charmed away in a day or two by the
best doctor in life. For the time a cure takes
must bear some proportion to the time the
complaint has lasted. I wish you to pin your
faith on those facts, and bear them in mind.</p>

<p>If it be true that in nearly all cases of the
chronic debility I refer to—and I sincerely
believe it is true—the blood-making process is
primarily at fault, then, before we can remove
the symptoms, it is evident we must attend to
the cause. And to do so we must go to the
fountain-head from which all the evil flows,
and this will be found to be the stomach. In
other words, these chronic complaints—with
all their aches and rheums and pains, bad
sleep, lowness of spirits, fluttering at the
heart, palpitations, and what are termed “indescribable
feelings”—may be due to a kind
of dyspepsia. The system is wholly too
sluggish; the liver is inactive, and consequently
the heart itself is weak, and being
unable to supply the brain and nervous
system generally with good, honest, life-giving
blood, all kinds of symptoms may occur.
These are often called imaginary, but they are
real enough, for all that.</p>

<p>I have said that the taking of medicine may
do actual harm. Have we any substitute?
Yes; and we find it in the use of vegetables
and fruit, both of which are very much neglected.</p>

<p>These supply the blood with certain salts of
a cooling nature, and without which the principal
internal vital organs are unable to secrete
material to keep the system regular.</p>

<p>Very often these organs act with great irregularity,
or by fits and starts, so that we
may have a patient complaining of two different
states of system in the same week.</p>

<p>Now, it is possible that the reader of these
lines is not to be ranked among the rich, who
keep one, two, three, or more gardeners, but
that still she lives in the country, and is in
possession of a patch of kitchen-garden. If
so, I seriously advise that it should be turned
to the very best account. I do not wish this
to be thought a gardening article, but, nevertheless,
I ought, for health’s sake, to throw
out a hint or two about the vegetables that
ought to be grown for health’s sake, and I
will leave it for others to say how this green
food is to be cooked.</p>

<p>Ladies are fond of doing a bit of flower-gardening,
but, as a rule, they abjure the
cultivation of vegetables, or they know nothing
really about it. It is a pity this should be so,
for the kitchen-garden, if not a large one,
certainly does not entail a deal of hard work,
and the work is of a sort most conducive to
health.</p>

<p>I shall suppose that you have secured the
services of some “male creature,” in, say, the
month of February or March, to do the first
or rough work—the turning over of the
ground with the spade—and that he has
secured sufficient richness of the soil, and
done his work well, and left it level, and that
you yourself are to sow the seeds.</p>

<p>Under your own superintendence, then, the
beds are mapped out, the width of each being
exactly the same (say six feet), and their
length equal to the breadth of the plot of
ground to be under cultivation. Between each
bed there is formed a hollow division or path
about a foot wide, and the beds are not to
encroach upon the borders round, which
are sacred to gooseberry bushes, rose-trees,
flowers, and currants, black and red.</p>

<p>Choose a fine, sunny day to sow your seeds.
First rake your beds most levelly and carefully,
not leaving a ball of earth even an inch in
diameter. When well raked they should be
as level as a dining-room table, not all in little
heaps, as if the Cochins had been scraping
them.</p>

<p>Make the drills—by aid of a garden line
and foot rule—with the back of the rake, and
not more than an inch and a half deep, each
drill to be nine inches apart; put peas in two
rows, only six inches apart, and a foot and a
half between each double row. This foot and a
half may seem a waste of ground, but it need
not be so, as in the centres you can put a
drill of summer spinach.</p>

<p>Having sown your seeds, rake the ground
gingerly and tenderly, filling up the little
drills, and making each bed a thing of beauty.
About two weeks or less after this, it really
will be a thing of beauty, for I know of few
prettier sights in a garden on a lovely spring
day than rows of green seedlings that have
just burst through the earth. You can watch
them grow day by day, and listen to the birds
singing at the same time. If the weather is
propitious they will soon want thinning, and
for a week or two your work will be cut out
for you. Do not say you can ill spare the
time. It will be time saved and health
gained. Rise in the morning and work an
hour before breakfast, and do a little more in
the evening. In thinning the plants, leave in
the best and biggest, and let there be six to
nine inches between each. Pluck all the
weeds out at the same time, and put weedings
and thinnings all in a small basket; I say
small basket, because there is no room for a
big one between the beds, and no mark must
be left of foot or anything else on the bed
itself.</p>

<p>I can assure readers that work like this may
be done by the most dainty fingers, and that it
will restore the bloom to lips and cheeks,
however pale these were before. You may
wear what you like and look as charming as
you please when gardening; thus, so long as
you do the work honestly, you may wear the
most dainty hats and gloves, and have a
mahogany handle to your hoe if so minded,
though, between you and me, six-button kid
gloves are not the best suited for weeding
onions in.</p>

<p>The great advantage in growing one’s own
vegetables is that one can always have them
fresh. Lettuces cool, green, and tender;
potatoes laughing from the mould, and peas
with the drops of morning dew still lingering
inside their pods.</p>

<p>That is all I mean to say about gardening;
if you wish to learn more, buy a book, and
study it, only I can promise you health if you
adopt gardening as an exercise and a hobby.</p>

<p>But you must partake of the fruits of your
labour; and this leads me to say a few words
about the benefits to the health of a partly
vegetable diet. Remember, I am not a
vegetarian, but I can tell you as a fact that
you could live far longer on vegetables alone
than you could upon meat alone.</p>

<p>Potatoes come first. No dinner—or to
my thinking, no luncheon either—is complete
without them.</p>

<p>Some interesting papers in the early part of
this volume gave hints as to the cooking of
potatoes. Let me add another. To the
delicate no vegetable is more difficult of
complete digestion if not boiled to a nicety,
but they ought to be mashed as well, and I do
not think I ever saw them properly mashed at
an English table. They ought to be as
smooth and white as custard, though not so
thin, otherwise little lumps remain, which,
even if no bigger than a pea, are most
indigestible, and never fail to create unpleasantness
afterwards.</p>

<p>Done as the French do them, namely, fried
in oil, they are also indigestible.</p>

<p>Potatoes are not only most nutritious, but
are calmative to the nerves, and to some
extent, narcotic, especially new potatoes.</p>

<p>A potato salad—lettuces included—is a
most valuable adjunct to a supper dish.</p>

<p>We have to learn from the Scotch how to
serve potatoes, and we must also cross the
Border to find out the most delicious and
digestible form in which to serve ordinary
green vegetables. These include cabbages,
curly greens, sprouting broccoli, savoys, turnip-tops,
spinach, and kale of all kinds; and all
these should be mashed for the delicate, the
strongest portions of midribs being taken out,
and a little butter and salt well mixed with
them in the mashing. They should be served
hot, and eaten off a hot plate with a little
bread, as a dish, before any meat has been
partaken of.</p>

<p>In this way we not only get their full
flavour, but the greatest benefit to the blood
from their use.</p>

<p>Next in point of value to the delicate come
cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts. These need
not be mashed, but ought to be used as a dish,
with a little bread and butter. The same may
be said of seakale.</p>

<p>No one should omit having half-a-dozen
times at least during the early spring months
a dish of nicely-cooked nettle-tops.</p>

<p>Nettle-tops should be very young and tender.
Only those of a light spring-green colour
are to be culled. They possess the same properties—of
a blood-purifying order—that asparagus
does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">{358}</span></p>

<p>Watercresses may usually be had all the
year round, and are far more valuable than
most people would imagine; but I desire to
warn my readers against eating them unless
very well washed indeed, as the eggs of certain
parasites sometimes cling to their leaves.</p>

<p>Parsley is not over-digestible, but if it
agrees it will do the blood good, and help to
cool and sweeten the system.</p>

<p>Beetroot is invaluable to all who suffer from
indigestion, with a dry condition of the body.</p>

<p>As to roots, besides the potato, which
ought to go with everything, we have turnips,
parsnips, and carrots. On these we can ring
the changes. But the same rule as to serving
applies to them as to ordinary green vegetables.
Let them be carefully boiled, then
well mashed, butter and salt being mixed.</p>

<p>There are many other vegetables that I have
not space here to say a word about; but as,
with the Editor’s kind permission, I may have
an autumn or late summer paper on garden
herbs and their dietary and medicinal values, I
can then mention those I have here omitted.</p>

<p>I have not said what I wanted to about
fruit either; but the delicate should not let a
day pass without using it in some form.
Especially is it of great value before breakfast.</p>

<p>As to onions and all vegetables of that sort,
while I admit their great value and efficacy in
chronic complaints, I must bid you beware.
Use them only if they can be easily digested
and leave no dryness in the throat or taste in
the mouth next day.</p>

<p>Now from this paper I hope many will adopt
valuable hints. If they do, they will be rewarded
with obtaining purer blood in their
veins, stronger nerves, and a happier frame of
body and mind altogether.</p>

of Casabianca had
fascinated me, and I
could see it fascinated
Rolf.</p>

<p>“How I do like
that fellow Cassy——what
do you call
him?” he exclaimed,
enthusiastically,
when I had finished.
“I call that plucky,
and no mistake, to
stick to the burning ship.
What a brave man he
would have made if he
had lived!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; but he
lived long enough to do a man’s work in
the world—faithful until death. ‘Faithful
in little, faithful in much,’ Rolf. Casabianca
would never have disobeyed his
mother, or thought he knew best, would
he?”</p>

<p>“No, Fenny,” in a contrite voice,
and sidling up to me again.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you can never be a
soldier, dear!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”—sitting up
erect in bed, with his beautiful eyes
quite glaring at me in the twilight. “I
mean to be a soldier, I tell you, and use
father’s sword! I shall be Colonel
Markham, too, one of these days, unless
I am killed in battle.”</p>

<p>“You cannot be a soldier unless you
learn to obey, Rolf; you cannot rule
your men until you have submitted to
rule yourself. Officers are gentlemen,
and gentlemen are never cowards; and
I call it cowardly, Rolf—quite a mean
trick—to creep into the nursery in my
absence. Honour should have kept you
from crossing the threshold.”</p>

<p>Now Rolf could not endure to be
called a coward, so he lost his temper,
and, I am sorry to say, called me a
nasty, spiteful old cat, “which you are
Fenny, you know you are, and a great
deal worse!” And the next moment he
had thrown a rough pair of arms round
my neck, his penitence inflicting on me
excruciating pain.</p>

<p>“There, there, never mind”—hugging
me—“I don’t mean it. You are a dear
old thing, Fenny, and I mean to marry
you when I grow up. You are such a
plain young woman, as mother says,
that no one else would ask you, so I
will.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I could marry a
coward, Rolf?”</p>

<p>“There you go again”—in a vexed
voice—“but I shall never be a coward
any more; I mean to be a brave boy,
like Cassy—what do you call him? I
mean to mind mother, and not forget;
and I will throw my cannon into the sea
to-morrow, though I am so fond of it,
and Mr. Rossiter (Walter I call him,
but he does not mind) gave it to me. It
cost a lot—indeed, it did, Fenny—but,
all the same, it shall be drownded
dead.”</p>

<p>“If thine eye offend thee, pluck it
out.” I think there was something very
real in that childish sacrifice. It was
his treasured plaything, but it had
tempted him to disobedience; he would
fling it away with both hands. How
few of us repent in that way! <i>Mea
culpa</i>, we say, but we hug our darling
sin close to us; it is not, like Rolf’s
cannon, “drownded dead.” Brave, poor
little faulty Rolf, I begin to have better
hopes of you!</p>

<p>So I kissed and comforted Rolf, and
he clung to me quite affectionately. I
asked him if he had said his prayers,
and he said no, he had been too unhappy,
because no one would forgive
him; so we said them together, and
afterwards we had a little more talk. I
was just going to leave him when a
light crossed the threshold, and there
stood Mrs. Markham, with a lamp in
her hand. She looked very ill and unhappy,
and I am sure she had been
shedding tears.</p>

<p>Rolf sprang up in bed. “Oh, mother,
do forgive me!” he cried. “I am sure
I have been miserable long enough.
Fenny has been telling me about Cassy—you
know the fellow; and I mean to
be like him. I will drown my dear little
cannon, and I will never, never, never
disobey you again!”</p>

<p>I think Mrs. Markham was longing
in her heart to forgive him. She had
suffered as much as the child. She said
nothing, but sat down on the bed and
held out her arms, and Rolf nestled into
them. She kissed him almost passionately,
but a tear rolled down her face.</p>

<p>“I think you will break my heart one
day, Rolf, as your——” She checked
herself, and did not finish her sentence.
Did she mean Rolf’s father? Colonel
Markham had been a brave officer, I
knew, and had died in battle; but he
had not made his wife happy.</p>

<p>“Oh no, mother,” returned Rolf, “I
am going to be a brave man, like father,
and fight for everybody. I mean to take
care of you when you are an old, old
woman. Won’t that be nice? You won’t
mind my marrying Fenny when I am
quite grown up, will you, mother?
Because she is such an old dear—not
really old, you know, but so nice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham smiled faintly at the
boy’s nonsense, but she looked at me
very pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you for talking to Rolf, Miss
Fenton, and helping him to be good.
He is sorry, I think, and I hope this
painful lesson will teach him to be less
mischievous. But now you look very
unfit to be up. You have done us all
good service to-day, and we are all
extremely grateful. Let me help you
back to your room.”</p>

<p>I was very much astonished at this
civility, but I declined her assistance
and wished Rolf good-night. I was
still more surprised when she held out
her hand.</p>

<p>“You must be careful of yourself,
Miss Fenton, for my sister’s sake,” she
said, so kindly that I could hardly
believe it was Mrs. Markham’s voice.</p>

<p>I marvelled at her manner greatly as
I retraced my steps to the night nursery.
She was really grateful to me, I could
see that. Probably she realised that
my prompt action had saved her and
her boy a lifetime of regret. To extinguish
life accidentally must be a bitter
and sore retrospect to any human mind.
Rolf’s boyhood would have been
shadowed if his little cousin’s death
had laid at his door.</p>

<p>I tried to cheer myself with these
thoughts as I laid awake through
the greater part of that long summer’s
night. I could only sleep by snatches,
and my dreams were full of pain. I
imagined myself a martyr at Smithfield,
and that the faggots were lighted about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">{359}</span>
my feet. I could see the flames curling
up round me, and feel their scorching
breath on my face. Excruciating pain
seemed to tingle in my veins; I cried
out and woke Joyce, and then the misery
of my burns kept me restless. I was
quite ill the next day, and could not stir
from my bed; but Mrs. Markham and
Rolf came to see me more than once,
and Reggie played on my bed, and was
so dear and good, and Joyce kept creeping
up to me to know what she could do
for nurse, and every two or three hours
Gay’s bright face seemed to bring sunshine
into the room.</p>

<p>She had always some pleasant thing
to tell me: a kind inquiry from Mr.
Hawtry, and some flowers and fruit
that Mrs. Cornish had arranged; a book
from the vicar’s wife, who had been very
shocked to hear of the accident, and
thought I wanted amusement; a message
from Squire Cheriton, with a basket of
fine yellow plums that he had picked
himself; and, later in the evening, a tin
of cream and some new-laid eggs from
Wheeler’s Farm, that Molly had brought
herself.</p>

<p>I begged to see Molly, and she came
up at once, looking very respectable in
her Sunday gown and straw bonnet
crossed with yellow ribbons. She shook
hands heartily until I winced with pain,
and then begged my pardon for her
carelessness.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for your delicious
presents, Molly,” I said, gratefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t mention it, Miss
Fenton; it is pleasure to me and father
to send it, and father’s duty; and there
is a chicken fattening that will be all
ready for eating on Thursday; and there
is a pot or two of cherry jam that I shall
take the liberty to send with it. It is
just for the children and yourself, as I
shall tell Mrs. Murdle.”</p>

<p>“Everyone is far too good to me,” I
stammered, and the tears came into my
eyes, for the old Squire and Gay had
been so kind, and there was all those
beautiful flowers and fruit from the Red
Farm, and now this good creature was
overwhelming me with homely delicacies.
Molly patted me with her rough hand as
though I had been a child, and then
kissed me in her hearty way.</p>

<p>“There, there, poor dear, who could
help being good to you, seeing you lie
there as helpless as a baby, with your
poor arms all done up in cotton wool,
and the pain hard to bear? Never mind,
the Lord will help you to bear it, and He
knows what pain means.” And with
this homely consolation Molly left me
and went in search of Hannah.</p>

<p>When Gay came to me to see I was
all comfortable for the night, I asked
her rather anxiously if she expected to
hear from Mrs. Morton in the morning.</p>

<p>She looked as though she were sorry I
had asked the question. “Well, no—the
fact is, I wrote the letter, Merle,
but father forgot to post it, and it has
not gone yet. I am very sorry,” as I
uttered an exclamation of annoyance,
“but it cannot be helped, and it was all
father’s fault; he is so careless with
letters; but now Adelaide has written
to say how well Reggie seems to-day,
and both of them shall go by the same
post to-morrow morning. Benson shall
take them.”</p>

<p>It was no use saying any more. Gay
was sorry enough, and it was not her
fault, so I only asked her to add a word
or two to explain the delay, and this she
promised to do. She wanted to write to
Aunt Agatha as well, but I would not
hear of this. Aunt Agatha was very
tender-hearted, and could not bear to
hear of any suffering that she could not
remedy, and I could see no benefit in
harrowing her feelings. I would tell her
myself one day.</p>

<p>Dr. Staples had given me a sedative,
so I slept more that night, but it was
three days before I could leave my bed,
and all that time we heard nothing of my
mistress. On the fourth day I put on a
dressing-gown Gay lent me, with loose
hanging sleeves, for my arms were still
swathed like mummies, but the pain had
lessened; and though I was weak enough
only to lean back in an easy chair and
watch the children at their play, I liked
to be with them, and it was pleasant to
sit by the nursery window and look
out on the terrace and sundial and the
sunny orchard with the old white pony
grazing as usual.</p>

<p>Gay had come up that morning with
rather a troubled face. They had had a
letter from Alick, she said, but he had
not received either hers or Adelaide’s.
Violet had seemed so ill that he had
taken her home to Prince’s Gate that
Dr. Myrtle might see her. They had
left Abergeldie before their letters had
arrived, and he could not possibly
receive them until the next morning, but
of course they would be forwarded at
once.</p>

<p>I was much distressed to hear that
the letters had miscarried, and still
more that my mistress was ill. It was
dreary taking her back to that great
empty house; but then Dr. Myrtle
understood her constitution, and would
do her more good than a stranger. I
begged Gay to tell me what was the
matter, but she did not seem to know.
It was a collapse, Alick had said, a
sudden serious failure of strength; he
had written very hurriedly, and seemed
worried and anxious.</p>

<p>“I wish I need not have told you all
this, Merle,” she finished. “It has made
you paler than you were before. Violet
has never been strong since Joyce was
born, but I do not see that there is any
need for special anxiety.” But though
Gay insisted on taking a cheerful view of
things, I could not bring my spirits to
her level. I felt nervous and unaccountably
depressed. I had not sufficiently
recovered from the effects of the accident
to bear the least suspense with equanimity.
In spite of my efforts to be
quiet and self-controlled, I grew restless
and irritable; the least noise jarred on
me; it was a relief when Hannah took
the children out and I had the nursery to
myself. My nervous fancies haunted
my dreams that night, and I woke so
unrefreshed that Gay scolded me for
not getting better more quickly, and
pretended to laugh at my dismal face
when I heard there was no letter from
Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>“It is nonsense your fretting about
those letters, Merle,” she said, in her
brisk way. “Alick has them by this
time, and we shall hear from him before
evening. Do, pray, pull yourself together,
and I will ask Dr. Staples if a
drive will not do you good; your indoor
life does not suit you.”</p>

<p>I did not contradict her, but I knew
there would be no drive for me that day;
perfect quiet and rest were all I wanted,
and I knew Dr. Staples would be of my
opinion. The afternoon was showery,
so the children played about the nursery.
I did not admit Rolf, for his noisy ways
would have been too much for me, but
he was very good, and promised to stay
with Judson if he might come to me a
little in the evening.</p>

<p>I had gone into the night nursery to
lie down for an hour when I heard footsteps
coming down the passage. The
next moment I heard Mr. Morton’s
voice speaking to Gay.</p>

<p>“You can go in and see the children,
Alick,” she said, “and I will join you
directly, when Adelaide has finished
with me;” and then Joyce called out
“Fardie,” and I could hear Reggie
stumping across the floor.</p>

<p>I waited a few minutes before I made
my appearance. Much as I longed to
see Mr. Morton, I thought he would
rather meet his children alone. I almost
felt as though I intruded when I
opened the door. Hannah was not
there, and he was sitting in my rocking-chair
with Reggie in his arms, and his
head was bowed down on the little
fellow’s shoulder. He started up when
he heard me, but I never saw him look
so pale and agitated. I knew then that
he was a man of strong feelings, that
his children were more to him than I had
dreamed.</p>

<p>“Miss Fenton,” he began, and then
he bit his lips and turned away to the
window. I saw he could hardly speak,
and there was Reggie patting his face
and calling “Fada, fada,” to make
him smile.</p>

<p>“Reggie is quite well,” I said, feeling
the silence awkward.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” quite abruptly, “I see he
is; thank God for that mercy; but,
Miss Fenton, you have suffered in his
stead. You are looking ill, unlike yourself.
What am I to say to you? How am
I to thank you?”</p>

<p>“Please do not say anything to me,”
I returned, on the verge of crying.
“Dear little Reggie is all right, and
I am only too thankful. Tell me about
my mistress, Mr. Morton; we are all so
anxious about her.”</p>

<p>I thought he looked a little strangely
at me. He held out his hand without
speaking. That hearty grasp spoke
volumes. Then he cleared his throat and
said, quickly, “She does not know; I
have not told her; she is very weak and
ill. Dr. Myrtle says we must take
great care of her; she has been over-exerting
herself.”</p>

<p>To my dismay and his I burst into
tears, but I was not quite myself, liable
to be upset by a word.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is always over-exerting herself;
she does more every day than her
strength will allow,” I cried, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">{360}</span>
hysterically. “It makes one’s heart
ache to see her so worn out and yet so
patient. Oh, Mr. Morton, do let me
come home and nurse her; she is never
happy without the children; it will do
her good to see them; she frets after
them too, and it makes her ill. Do let
me come home; there is nothing I would
not do for her.”</p>

<p>I heard him beg me to be calm. I
was ill myself, I heard him say, and no
wonder, and he looked pityingly at my
bandages.</p>

<p>“I only wish you could come back to
us, Miss Fenton,” he went on, so kindly
that I was ashamed of giving way so.
“The home feels very empty, and I
think it would do my dear wife good to
have the children’s feet pattering overhead.
She is too weak to have them
with her just now, but it would be pleasant
to know they were near.”</p>

<p>I pleaded again that we might come
home, and he smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>“You must get well first,” he said,
gently, “and then I will come and fetch
you all back myself. Just now you
require nursing, and are better where
you are; and it is still hot in London,
and the sea breezes will benefit the
children a little longer. Come, you will
be sensible about this, Miss Fenton.”</p>

<p>And then, as Gay joined us, he turned
to her and reiterated his opinion that I
must stay at Marshlands until I was well.</p>

<p>Of course, Gay agreed with him; but
I thought she was a little graver than
usual. I knew Mr. Morton was right.
I was no use to anyone just now; but,
all the same, it made me feel very unhappy
to see him go away and leave us
behind. He could not stay any longer,
he said, for fear of arousing his wife’s
suspicions. He should just tell her he
had run down to have a peep at the
children; that would please her, he
knew. He bade me good-bye very
kindly, and told me to keep up my
courage, and not lose heart. I could
see he was not vexed with me for giving
way. No doubt he attributed it all to
weakness.</p>

<p>I sat down and had a good cry when
he had left us, and there was no denying
that I was homesick that night, and
wanted Aunt Agatha. I felt a poor
creature in my own estimation. Perhaps
I was impatient; Dr. Staples told me I
was, and his eyes twinkled as he said it;
but it seemed to me I recovered very
slowly. The burns were healing nicely;
in a few more days I could put on my
dress and enjoy the country drives; but
I did not resume my usual duties for
some time.</p>

<p>I could not dress and undress the
children; walking tired me, and my
spirits were sadly variable. The news
from Prince’s Gate did not cheer me:
my mistress continued in the same unsatisfactory
state. Mr. Morton wrote
every day, and both Mrs. Markham and
Gay had gone up to town for a few
hours. I heard more from Mrs. Markham
than from Gay. She thought her
sister looking very ill, and considered
there was grave cause for anxiety. She
had an excellent nurse, and her husband
was most devoted in his attentions; she
had never seen anyone to equal him.
Here Mrs. Markham sighed; but her
sister looked dull and depressed, and
she thought she missed the children.</p>

<p>The bright September days passed
away very slowly. I was growing weary
of my banishment; and yet Marshlands
and Netherton had become very dear to
me, and I had grown to love the quaint
old nursery. I was thankful when my
strength permitted me to resume our
mornings on the beach and our afternoons
in the orchard. I felt less restless
out of doors, and I liked to have Rolf
with me. I saw very little of Gay; just
then she was busy with parish work. I
heard from her casually one day that
Mr. Hawtry had gone to Italy. I suppose
I looked astonished, for she said,
quickly—</p>

<p>“He called the other afternoon and
asked to see the children, but Adelaide
had taken you all for a drive. I thought
he seemed a little sorry not to say good-bye
to them, as he expected to be away
some time. He hoped you were better,
Merle, and desired his kind regards.”</p>

<p>“And he has gone to Italy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a young cousin of his is lying
dangerously ill at Venice, and so this
Don Quixote has started off to see after
him. It is just like him, he is always
doing things for other people.” And with
this speech she left me.</p>

<p>I was sorry not to say good-bye to
Mr. Hawtry; he had been very kind to
us, and it seemed such a pity that we
had missed him that afternoon. I often
thought about our visit to the Red Farm,
and how pleasant and hospitable he had
been. It seemed rather tantalising just
to make friends (and he had always
been so friendly to me) and then not to
see them again, but perhaps next summer
we should come down to Marshlands
again.</p>

</div><p><span class="uppercase">rs.</span> Shelley was
quite right in saying
Fairy’s sorrows
were short-lived.
For one
whole day she
had been very
miserable, the day
after Rex had
asked her, and
she had promised, to be his wife,
when Mr. Leslie had called and told
her she was not to see Rex any
more till the carnival. Coming so soon
after her great happiness, Fairy could
not bear this sudden reverse with equanimity,
and so, as Reginald had told the
baroness, she had cried all day, until
John had meekly yielded and allowed
another interview.</p>

<p>After this Fairy was quite satisfied;
Rex loved her, and that was in itself
happiness. That he would be true to
her she no more doubted than she
doubted the sun would rise the next day,
and so, though of course she would have
preferred him to remain at Oafham and
spend his afternoons with her, she acquiesced
cheerfully in Mr. Leslie’s plan,
and was as bright and happy during the
months of October and November as it
was possible for even such a little sunbeam
to be.</p>

<p>When November dawned, and it was
arranged that Fairy should go to the
Leslies on the 3rd for a week or two,
her excitement was so great that Mrs.
Shelley told her if she did not take care
she would be ill and unable to go, at
which she only laughed, and said there
was no fear of her being ill, and as for
eating, she was much too happy to be
hungry. One little thing was rather
troubling Fairy; she was half afraid her
dress was not quite all it ought to be for
such a grand gentleman as Rex’s father,
whose acquaintance she was to make on
the 5th. If it had only been summer-time
it would not have mattered, for
nothing could be prettier than one of
her simple white frocks; they would do
for anyone or anything; but she could
not wear a thin white dress in November.
Her best winter dress was a red merino,
new for the occasion, and as she dressed
herself in it when it came home, she
could not help acknowledging inwardly,
as she glanced at her dainty little self in
the glass, her delicate complexion set
off to the best advantage by the dark
red merino, if she only had some lace to
put round the throat, her toilet would
compare favourably with the blue silks
of the Leslie girls.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp57" id="i361" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i361.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LEWES CARNIVAL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps there was some lace among
the things she had on when John Shelley
found her; she believed there was, so,
unlocking the drawer in which she had
always kept these relics, she pulled them
out and glanced at them. There on the
top lay the blue satin quilt, the large
piece missing which she had cut out
years ago to make a shaving-case for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">{362}</span>
Jack. Poor Jack! Where was he
now? What would he say to her engagement?
Would he be pleased at
it? Somehow Fairy feared he would
not. But there was enough of the quilt
left to make a shaving-case for Rex; it
would be just the thing for him, and
nice work to do at the Leslies’, so the
remains of the quilt were packed up to
go with her. Then came the red Indian
shawl, in which the baron had wrapped
his little daughter. How handsome it
was! Why, not one of the Leslie girls
had such a handsome shawl as this, all
embroidered with gold. She would certainly
take this with her; it would do
beautifully to wrap round her in the
balcony from which they were to watch
the carnival. Rex would like this
shawl, she was sure, so that, too, was
packed up. All the other little garments,
yellow with being laid up so
long, were now looked through to see if
there was any lace that would do, but
no, it was all too narrow, and Fairy was
about to shut the drawer when she
caught hold of the lace handkerchief
which had been tucked into her dress
under her chin as a feeder when she
was found. She looked at it with a
critical eye. How fine it was, and what
lovely lace, and how pretty that crest
and coronet worked in the corner were!
This handkerchief was the very thing;
she would fold it so that the corner with
the crest showed, and wear it round her
throat instead of a lace tucker.</p>

<p>So the handkerchief was packed up
with the other things, and on Monday
afternoon Fairy went to the Leslies to
stay. The carnival was not till Wednesday
evening, but she hoped to see Rex
on Tuesday, as she knew he was expected
to reach Oafham before then.
Nor was she disappointed, for on
Tuesday morning Rex arrived to lunch,
and spent a long afternoon.</p>

<p>Fairy found he was most anxious she
should make a conquest of his father,
and seemed to think their future happiness
depended in a great measure upon
the effect she produced upon Mr. de
Courcy, so that Rex was looking forward
to the carnival with somewhat mixed
feelings, and, to the disappointment of
the Leslies, could not be persuaded to
appear in fancy dress, which they assured
him was the correct thing for
young men in all ranks of life on this
unique occasion. But Rex refused, declaring
he only intended to be a spectator,
and his time would be fully occupied
in taking care of Fairy, which no
one for one moment doubted. Since
masks were considered indispensable,
he agreed to wear a wire mask to protect
his face from the squibs and
crackers, which are recklessly flung in
all directions, often doing serious injury
to some of the passers-by, but this was
the utmost he would concede, and Fairy
seconded him, declaring that though
she liked him very much as he was, she
was by no means sure how she would
like him if he were dressed up like
another person.</p>

<p>The Leslies had hired a window in the
High-street, and here Mr. de Courcy
and Rex were to meet them at seven
o’clock to watch the revelry, and then
they were all to return to the rectory to
supper. Fairy, who had of course often
seen the carnival before, was full of
childish delight at the prospect, and
kept assuring Rex it was the most wonderful
sight he had ever seen; there was
nothing like it in England; she was
sure he would be enchanted; the only
drawback was there were sure to be one
or two riots, as some turbulent spirits
always insulted the Roman Catholics
before the evening was over.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope they won’t insult my
father; he is a Roman Catholic,” said
Rex.</p>

<p>“Your father a Roman Catholic, Rex!
Are you one, too?” asked Fairy, turning
a little pale.</p>

<p>“No, I am a Protestant, so is my
mother, but I don’t think it right to
make game of other people’s religion,
and insult them because it differs from
ours, do you?”</p>

<p>“You are like John. He says it is
very wicked, and that the carnival does
more harm than good. He only goes
to try and help to keep order, but I like
it, it is such a pretty sight,” replied
Fairy, eagerly.</p>

<p>In Lewes the preparations began
early in the afternoon, when the shops
were closed, and all the lower windows
in the High-street, through which the
procession was to pass, were boarded
up—a very necessary precaution, for the
reckless flinging of lighted torches,
squibs, and crackers would otherwise
have broken the windows, and perhaps
set fire to the houses.</p>

<p>In the Market-place arrangements
were made for the making of an enormous
bonfire, in which the effigies of
Guy Faux, the Pope, and any public
person, whether of local or of wider fame,
who happened just then to be in bad
odour with the Lewes people, were to be
burnt at midnight—the closing scene in
the drama.</p>

<p>A little after seven o’clock the Leslies’
carriage drove up to the house in which
they had hired the drawing-room balcony
to view the proceedings. At present
all that was to be seen were young
men and boys with lighted torches in
their hands, and most of them in fancy
dress, rushing wildly about the streets,
shouting and singing and throwing
squibs and crackers in all directions.</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie hurried his party into the
house as quickly as possible, and then
sent the carriage home, for later on all
traffic would be stopped, and the girls
had come prepared to walk back.</p>

<p>On reaching the drawing-room they
found Mr. de Courcy and Rex had just
arrived; a large fire was blazing on the
hearth, but there were no other lights in
the room, interior darkness being the
rule at the Lewes carnival, in order that
the outside festivities may be all the
more brilliant.</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie introduced Mr. de Courcy
to his wife and daughters, and then to
Fairy, who was looking so bewitchingly
pretty with her red Indian shawl twisted
round her head in some wonderful way
which exactly suited her, that it was
evident Mr. de Courcy was struck by her
beauty, the flickering light of the fire
and the shawl which hid her lovely
golden hair, and partly veiled her slight
figure, only piquing his curiosity. He
began to talk to her at once in his broken
English, and her charming manners
fascinated him almost as much as they
did his son, and when he found she
spoke French fluently, and with the
prettiest accent possible, Fairy’s triumph
was complete. Mr. de Courcy,
always a great admirer of girls, was
quite captivated, and Rex whispered to
Fairy she had succeeded already. The
procession was to leave the Market-place
at eight, and go round the town,
but even now it was a weird scene, the
masqueraders passing up and down the
streets in their costumes, some of them
excellently got up, others so grotesquely
as to be quite as amusing as the elaborate
fancy dresses prepared by costumiers,
the torches carried by them throwing
a weird, uncertain light on their wild,
uncertain antics. From time to time a
passage of arms occurred between some
passing Cavaliers and Roundheads, but
at present all was harmless fun, everyone
being in a good temper at this early
stage of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Fairy and Rex managed to get a
corner of the balcony to themselves,
from which she tried to explain the
various costumes, oftener, as Rex told
her, discovering the original people than
the characters they were intended to represent.
These two alone were not
impatient for the procession to pass,
being so much occupied with themselves
as to pay but little attention to what
was going on in the street. Occasionally
a grand excitement was caused by
the rolling past of a lighted tar-barrel,
which illuminated the whole street, its
attendant youths, many of whom were
dressed like demons, looking in their
black masks and asses’ ears more like
fiends than men as they lashed their
blazing barrels with their torches, sending
the sparks far and wide.</p>

<p>“This is the Bournemer barrel, and
that is Charlie with an axe, dressed as
an executioner. I made his black mask
for him. Look, Rex,” cried Fairy, as
another and the last of the barrels rolled
into the Market-place, to return presently
with the procession.</p>

<p>A few minutes later there passed a
riotous group of violent anti-papists,
bearing a banner with “No popery”
on it, carried reluctantly by a scarlet
woman, or rather a man dressed in
woman’s clothes of bright red, supposed
to represent the Church of Rome. On
one side of her was a man in Geneva
gown and bands, on the other another
in a long surplice, hood, and stole, carrying
a large book, and these two, with a
great deal of rough horseplay, kept the
scarlet woman up to the mark. This
centre group was surrounded by men
and boys carrying torches and screaming,
“Down with popery!” at the top
of their voices.</p>

<p>“That group will have a row before
they are satisfied,” said Rex, turning
away, and looking in the opposite
direction, as the group passed on to the
Market-place. “But look, Fairy, who
is this good-looking man masquerading
without a mask as a shepherd? See, he
is looking up here,” said Rex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">{363}</span></p>

<p>Fairy looked, and saw by the light of
the torches cast behind by the anti-papist
group, a tall, handsome man,
dressed in a smock-frock and carrying
a crook, a face which, in spite of a beard
and moustache, she knew very well.</p>

<p>“Why, Rex, it is Jack; it is, it is! I
must speak to him. Jack, Jack, where do
you come from? Come up and speak
to me directly. Fancy Jack being here!
I must go, Rex, and let him in. Oh, Mr.
Leslie, here is Jack!” and Fairy ran into
the drawing-room, the red shawl falling
off her head, and her beautiful hair,
which was disarranged by the shawl,
streaming down her shoulders in wild
confusion. Her cheeks were flushed with
excitement, her great brown eyes sparkling
with delight, as she went forward
with both hands outstretched, to meet
Jack at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>Rex was at first quite put out of countenance
by this unfortunate <i>contretemps</i>,
as he could not help thinking it; it
would undo all the good impression
Fairy had made upon his father; for not
knowing Jack, Rex supposed he was
like the rest of his family, and trembled
for the consequences if his father now
discovered Fairy was the foster-daughter
of a shepherd. How he wished he had
not called Fairy’s attention to the young
man, and how pleased they were to see
each other again. There really was no
occasion for that very long handshaking.
But here Mr. Leslie, seeing Rex looked
very crestfallen, went up to him and whispered
it was all right; Mr. de Courcy would
only suppose the truth, that Jack was
masquerading. Moreover, he added,
he is an excellent young fellow—very
superior, too, to his family; he might
pass very well in a crowd.</p>

<p>Rex was somewhat reassured; and
when Fairy drew him to Jack, whispering
that this was her <i>fiancé</i>, he tried
to be as pleased as Fairy could wish to
make his acquaintance, but somehow
both young men felt instinctively they
were rivals, and their intercourse was
constrained on both sides. Indeed,
Jack was anxious to get away as quickly
as possible, although he had come all
the way from America to see Fairy, and
judge for himself if the stories he had
heard in his mother’s last letter were
true. It did not require long to see
that they were, and his errand accomplished,
he felt his only safety was in
flight. That demon of jealousy which,
two years ago, had changed the whole
course of his life, and so nearly caused
him to be guilty of a terrible crime, was
again rising in his bosom, as he watched
the tender protecting air which Rex
assumed over Fairy. Though he had
learnt a severe lesson in self-control,
and had so far profited by it that he was
able to subdue the feeling of envy towards
his rival, and to mask from Fairy
the bitter sense of disappointment he
felt on seeing her the betrothed bride of
another, he felt the strain he was putting
upon himself would not last long,
and so he hastened to find an excuse in
order to be gone, inwardly resolving that
when he left the room he would never of
his own free will set eyes on Fairy
again.</p>

<p>She had drawn him out on to the
balcony, where he had a few minutes’
conversation with Mr. Leslie, to whom
he confided in an undertone that he was
going to Liverpool the next day with his
mother, on a visit to an uncle, where he
would remain until the next mail sailed
for America, where he had now decided
to remain for the rest of his life. He
had excellent prospects out there, and
was already getting on far better than
he had ever hoped to do in so short a
time. Already he had been made
cashier, and he had no doubt in a few
years he would be appointed manager
of the bank, as Mr. Leslie’s friend had
taken a great fancy to him. He was
now able to carry on his natural history
studies, and was making great progress,
and had hopes of one day becoming a
naturalist, for he now had the means of
procuring books which were before far
out of his reach, and the new country
opened out to him a new field of research.</p>

<p>All this he managed to tell Mr. Leslie
while the procession was still preparing
to start. He did not tell him what had
brought him to England, but Mr. Leslie
knew without being told that Fairy was
the motive power which had induced
him to cross the Atlantic, in the vain
hope of persuading her to return with
him as his wife. One glance at Rex
and Fairy had told Jack this hope was
futile, but still it was a satisfaction to
see for himself; and he would now go
back to his mother, and persuade her to
accompany him to Liverpool the next
day if possible.</p>

<p>He had only arrived at Lewes that
morning, and on finding that Fairy was
staying at the Leslies to go to the carnival
with them and Mr. de Courcy, he had
settled to go too in the hope of seeing her
without being seen. He had chosen to
wear his smock-frock for the first and
only time in his life, partly to please his
father, for whom Jack felt he could not
do enough to repay his kindness, when
he was under that black cloud which
had cast a shadow over all his life;
partly he wore it because Fairy made
it, and partly because he would attract
less attention among the masqueraders,
who would imagine he was a shepherd
come from some of the neighbouring
sheep farms to see the carnival, and
would not interfere with him; whereas if
he had walked about in plain clothes—and
he had no others with him—he
would probably have been mobbed.</p>

<p>He could not have settled in America
until he saw for himself that there was
no chance for him of winning Fairy.
Now he saw his fate was sealed, his
boyish dream shattered; there was
nothing left for him but to live it down;
and in a distant country, where there
was nothing to remind him of the love
of his youth, and where he had plenty
to interest and occupy him, he would
in time learn, not to forget her—that
was impossible, she was his first love,
and could never be altogether driven out
of his heart; one little secret chamber,
never peeped into even by himself,
would always remain sacred to her
memory—but he would learn to live
without her; and since the sooner he
began this lesson the better, he looked
about for an excuse to say good-bye.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe9_375" id="i363">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i363.jpg" alt="W" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">e</span> quoted a wise rule
in our third article
to the effect that
money should never
be allowed to lie
idle. Put to work
on its own account
money will make
money, and go on
growing and growing
even whilst the
person owning it is asleep or taking holidays.</p>

<p>Of course the wisest thing is to employ it
in one’s own business, turning it over and
over at a profit, under one’s own management.
But such advice is thrown away on those who
have no business.</p>

<p>What, then, are those who have money but
no business to do? They must entrust it to
people who want money for use in some way
or other, and are willing to pay interest for
the loan. It may be lent, for example, to the
British nation or to a foreign government, or
to some great railway, or to a bank, or a gas
company, or some municipal corporation.
Besides these opportunities for investing
money profitably, we have shares in joint
stock companies of all kinds, some of them
safe enough, but not a few of them to be
avoided by prudent people.</p>

<p>There are two things essential to a
satisfactory investment: First, the principal
must be quite safe; and, secondly, there must
be a reasonable certainty about the payment
of the interest. There is a third point
necessary to complete the happiness of the
investor: the interest must be the highest
possible under the circumstances. We say
“under the circumstances,” because in these
days really high interest and first-class security
never meet.</p>

<p>The safest investment for all who are
nervous about losing their money is in the
Government Stock—as it is called—of our own
country. They thus become creditors of the
British nation, than whom no people can be
imagined more secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">{364}</span></p>

<p>What is known as the <i>funded or permanent
debt</i> of Great Britain represents debt which
the Government is under no obligation to pay
off at any fixed time. It includes at present
loans distinguished as Consols, Reduced
Three per Cents., New Three per Cents.,
Two and a Half and Two and Three-quarters
per Cents., and some other stocks of less
consequence. “Consols,” we may add, is
an affectionate abbreviation of “Consolidated
Three per Cent. Annuities.” This permanent
debt at the present time amounts to nearly six
hundred and forty millions; the unfunded
debt and terminable annuities—the latter
being sums paid for a certain number of years
and then terminating altogether—amount to
over a hundred millions more. It is
melancholy to reflect that almost the whole of
the large sum represented by those different
items has been raised for the prosecution of
war, and spent in supplying food for powder,
spreading misery and destruction, and making
widows and orphans.</p>

<p>The possessors of Government Stock—that
is to say, the creditors who hold this debt
between them—are changing every day and
hour. People can sell their stock with the
greatest readiness, and there are always plenty
of buyers.</p>

<p>The price which national stock fetches is
not always the same. It improves when the
prospects of the country improve, and declines
in times of difficulty and danger. In the year
1800 war and dear corn, not to speak of other
things, made the national bond for £100 sell
for only £61, but since then peace, improved
prospects, and no lack of money seeking
investment, have forced the price up. The
average market value of £100 Consols in 1881
was just £100; in 1882 it was £100 10s.; in
1883, £101 3s. 9d.; in 1884, £101; and in
1885 it fell back to £99 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>There are two ways of purchasing Government
Stock—to any amount through a stockbroker,
and to a limited amount through the
Post Office. In the former case you may
either write to your banker, who will employ
his broker, or you can give the order to your
own broker. The commission charged by
brokers either for buying or selling is very
moderate. For transactions in either British
or foreign funds the rate is usually 2s. 6d. for
every £100 of stock.</p>

<p>To get payment of dividends on Government
Stock you may either go yourself to the
Bank of England or sign what is called a
<i>power of attorney</i> for your banker or broker
or someone you can trust to receive the
dividends for you. “In order to protect you
from fraud,” says the author of a “Guide to
the Unprotected,” “the power of attorney
should be made out for <i>dividends only</i>. That
is to say, it should authorise the person who
is to act on your behalf only to receive
dividends and not to sell the stock.” After a
power of attorney has been obtained no new
power for dividends is requisite by reason of
your increasing or lessening the amount of
your holding in the same description of
stock. Besides payment personally at the
Bank of England, stockholders can have their
dividends transmitted by post at their own
risk, and under certain regulations.</p>

<p>In selling stock you can manage the
transaction, just as you effected the purchase,
either through your banker or your own
broker.</p>

<p>We mentioned that Government Stock to
a limited amount could be bought through
the Post Office. When this is done the Post
Office relieves you of all trouble in purchasing
and in collecting dividends. The amount
invested must not be less than £10, and not
more than £100 of stock can be credited to an
account in any one year ending the 31st of
December, and when you have bought
through the Post Office £300 of stock in all
you can invest no more in this way, but must
go to a regular broker.</p>

<p>Suppose you wish through the Post Office
to buy £50 worth of “Consols,” you fill up a
form of application to be had at any post
office, and hand over the necessary amount to
the postmaster. Of course the latter part of
the performance will be unnecessary if you
have the sum already lying at your credit in
the Savings Bank. You then forward the
form of application, together with your
deposit book, to the head office.</p>

<p>In a few days your book will be returned
and you will find yourself debited with the
cost of the stock at the market price.
Suppose “Consols” are selling at £102,
then your fifty pounds worth will cost you a
half of that, and there will be an entry in
your book as a “withdrawal” of “Investment
£50 Consols, £51,” and besides that
will be entered “Commission, 1s. 3d.”</p>

<p>The book will be accompanied by a
“Certificate of investment in Government
Stock,” as follows:—</p>

<p>“This is to certify that £50 Consolidated £3
per Cent. Bank Annuities has been placed on
the Savings Banks Investment Account of the
National Debt Commissioners, that the same
has been credited in the Government Stock
Register of the Post Office Savings Bank to
______ of ______, and that her
deposit account has been charged with the
sum of £51 and 1s. 3d., being the price of the
said stock at £102 per cent., and commission
respectively.”</p>

<p>This certificate, which is signed by the
Controller, must be forwarded with the
deposit book and application whenever the
depositor wishes to sell the whole or a
portion of her stock. When stock is sold the
sale is effected at the <i>current price</i>—the price
in the open market on the day of sale—and a
warrant is sent to the depositor for the
amount realised, less the commission.</p>

<p>All dividends on the stock standing in a
depositor’s name are credited to her deposit
account when they become due. Dividends
on Consols are due half-yearly, on the 5th of
January and the 5th of July; those on what
are known as Reduced and New Three per
Cents. on the 5th of April and the 5th of
October. There are other Government
Stocks—Two and Three-quarters and Two
and a Half per Cent.—on which the dividends
are paid quarterly.</p>

<p>The commission charged by the Post Office
on investment is as follows:—</p>

<table class="autotable" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdr">s.</td>
<td class="tdr">d.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">On stock not exceeding £25</td>
<td class="tdr">0</td>
<td class="tdr">9</td>

<td class="tdr">2</td>
<td class="tdr">3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Not satisfied with working at these low rates,
the Post Office takes all the trouble of receiving
the dividends, and charges nothing for it.</p>

<p>The commission on the sale of stock up to
£100 is the same as for the purchase. For
the sale of stock exceeding £100 and not
exceeding £200, the charge is 2s. 9d.; exceeding
£200 and not exceeding £300, 3s. 3d.</p>

<p>But those who have money to lend have
wider scope for its employment than the
Public Funds. And here we may insert the
following handy table showing the better
class of investments, and the dividends to be
expected from them. We are indebted for it
to the ever-useful Almanack of Mr. Whitaker.</p>

<p>The following are <i>Trust Investments</i>, permitted
by the Court of Chancery:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three per Cent. “Consols” and “New
Annuities,” which at the present market price
yield barely 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Bank of England, Metropolitan Board of
Works 3½ per cent., and Indian Government
4 per cent. stocks, which gives £3 2s. 6d. to
£3 10s. per cent.</p>

<p>Canadian 4 per Cent. “Guaranteed” Loan,
giving £3 15s. per cent.</p>

<p>Turkish 4 per Cent. “Guaranteed” Loan,
giving £3 17s. 6d. per cent.</p>

<p>Bank of Ireland Stock, giving £3 10s. per
cent.</p>
</div>

<p>Then you have 4 to 5 per cent. investments,
quite secure:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Governments.</span>—Colonial Government
Securities: Dutch, Belgian, French, and
United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Railways.</span>—British Railway Debenture
Stocks, Indian Railway Debenture Stocks,
British Railway Preference Stocks, Indian
Railway Ordinary Stocks—these are
guaranteed by the Indian Government—British
Railway “Preferred” Ordinary
Stocks, British Railway Ordinary Stocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Docks.</span></p>

<p>Last come 5 to 6 per cent. investments,
which may be classed as moderately good:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Governments.</span>—Austrian, Brazilian,
Chilian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and
Russian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Railways.</span>—United States Railway
Bonds (on lines paying dividends on the
ordinary capital); Canadian Railway Bonds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gas Companies.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banks.</span>—Joint Stock Banks, <i>limited</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Above 6 per cent. there are no investments
that can safely be recommended.</p>

<p>Some foreign governments pay very
irregularly, and we may lay it down as a
wholesome rule that investments made without
the bounds of our own country should be
made with double caution. It is not so long
since we met a lady who had invested a considerable
sum with a republic which shall be
nameless, and which has since declined to pay
any portion back, or even to remember that
some fraction of interest might be acceptable
to its creditors.</p>

<p>In taking shares in a joint-stock company,
there is a caution to be observed that cannot
be too strongly insisted upon. A joint-stock
company is an association of a number of
people for the purpose of carrying on a trade
or some useful enterprise capable of yielding a
profit. Now, if ever you take shares in one,
whether it be a bank, or an insurance office, or
a mine or anything else, make sure that it
is established under the “Limited Liability
Act.” If the company be not a Limited
Liability concern, should it happen to fail, you
and every other shareholder are liable to lose
every penny you possess. In a Limited
Liability Company, however, you can only
lose the amount of the shares which you hold.
This is a great advantage: you know just
what you are liable for. It is worth remarking
that all Joint Stock Companies with limited
liability formed for the purpose of gain, are
obliged by law to use the word “Limited”
as the last word of their title.</p>

<p>When people have a good deal of money to
invest, and have a taste for limited companies,
in preference to the more solid security of the
public funds, it is wise not to put it all into
one concern. “Put it,” says one writer,
“into several. Then if one falls in value,
another probably rises, and so your income
will keep more equal. If one of your investments
turns out a failure, you lose only a part
and not the whole of your fortune.” And
“when you think,” adds the same authority,
“you have placed your money in the safest
way you can, do not alter its investment without
some good reason. Every change costs
money, and is attended with trouble and
anxiety.”</p>

<p>Those who know little about business are
often tempted by the prospect of a high dividend,
never thinking anything about the risk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">{365}</span>
they run. The great thing is security, however,
and a small return will never be grumbled
at by sensible people if it is accounted for by
the investment being a really safe one. It is
anything but a pleasant sensation when, instead
of an expected brilliant percentage, one receives
a letter to the effect that “the directors have
thought it right to suspend the business of the
—— Company, and close the share register,”
and that “after most carefully and anxiously
weighing all the circumstances of the case,
they are convinced that the only course is to
have the company wound up.”</p>

<p>In almost every newspaper we meet with
advertisements addressed to the unwary offering
shares in companies of which the worthless
character is at once recognised by the
experienced. It requires some knowledge of
the world not to be led away by emphatic
representations of “extraordinary success,”
“magnificent results,” “handsome profits,”
and “unprecedented opportunities.”</p>

<p>By way of warning, we may quote an anecdote
told by the author of “A Guide to the
Inexperienced.” “I heard it,” she says,
“from a person who had been almost persuaded
by a friend who knew nothing of business
to take some shares in a company which
<i>promised</i> extremely good interest.</p>

<p>“He went to the office, which was in the
City, to make inquiries. The manager tried
hard to persuade him to invest, assuring him
of the safety of the concern. While C——
was hesitating, a man rushed in and said, in
an eager tone—</p>

<p>“‘Pray, sir, have you any more shares on
sale? I have an order for fifty more. They
are in such great request that I am afraid of
their being all sold before I can get enough.’</p>

<p>“His manner and words opened C——’s
eyes, who suspected that this was a plan to
entrap him to invest, and he quietly walked
off. The company failed in a very short time
afterwards.”</p>

<p>We have spoken of investments in shares,
but shares are often bought, not as a matter
of investment, but as a speculation, the buyer
purchasing them with the expectation that
they will rise higher, and that he will then be
able to dispose of them at a profit. This is,
as a general rule, little better than gambling,
and a wise woman will keep out of it.</p>

<p>Every transaction in the stock market, whether
it be in Government stock, or in railway
shares, or in any other securities, must be effected
through the medium of a broker, who is thus not
only an adviser but an indispensable agent in
the transaction. Be sure to employ a broker
of good standing, and, having found a trustworthy
man, be rather guided by his advice
than by your own notions as to what purchases
are safe and what imprudent.</p>

<p>All documents connected with investments
should be carefully preserved, and dividends,
when they fall due, should be looked after.
It seems unnecessary to say so, but it is a
curious fact that, to speak of the public funds
alone, a large sum is added every year to the
revenue from unclaimed dividends. No stock
is reckoned unclaimed till ten years have
elapsed without the holder in any way giving
token of his or her existence; and yet in 1879
the amount credited to the item of “unclaimed
dividends” for the year ending 3rd January,
1880, was no less than £3,411,228!</p>

<p>The principal reason for this, no doubt, is
carelessness; but Mr. Walter M. Playford, in
his “Hints for Investors,” gives several other
reasons which are likely enough. Dividends
are often unclaimed through the misconception
of people who have sold stock. They
think they have sold with it a dividend, or a
portion of a dividend, to which they were
themselves entitled. Then, executors and administrators
are often unable to claim stock,
because those they represent have kept their
investments secret from their nearest friends.
And a good deal of money is not unfrequently
lost through the objectionable practice of investing
under a false name.</p>

<p>The current prices of all the more important
stocks for sale are chronicled day by day in
the newspapers. It is a department never
omitted in any well-regulated journal, even
though it forms the driest-looking column in
the paper. It is full of figures and tables of
figures, preceded by a few paragraphs, of a
very stereotyped aspect, and written in
language peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>We read therein that “the market is
easier,” or that “it assumed a more lively
appearance,” or that “it showed a falling
tendency,” or “great depression,” or that
“its tone remained very steady all day.” We
also read of “prices hardening a little,” of
“heavy stocks being inactive,” of “foreign
securities being quiet,” and grow familiar
with “Wabash Preferred,” “Nickel Plate
Common Stock,” “Spanish Externals,”
“Egyptian Unifieds,” and many other things
hard to be understood by the uninitiated.</p>

<p>It is a much-studied column, and it is
surprising what interest and entertainment
can be extracted from these daily reports of
the health and spirits of the money market if
it only takes the trouble to master the peculiar
vocabulary. The principal terms connected
with the investment of money we shall set
down here, with a few words of explanation for
each. A business woman—no matter whether
she has money to invest or not—should at
least know what they mean.</p>

<p><i>The Money Market</i> is a more or less
figurative expression, covering the whole field
for the investment or employment of money,
the leading dealers in the market being
bankers, bill discounters, and capitalists of all
sorts. Money is <i>cheap</i> or <i>dear</i> in the market
according as the rates for discount are low or
the reverse; and business is <i>brisk</i> or <i>flat</i>,
according as the amount of such discounts is
large or small.</p>

<p>A <i>stockbroker</i> is a broker who deals in the
purchase and sale of stocks or shares for
others. What is known as a <i>stockjobber</i> is
one who buys and sells stock on his own
account on speculation: he is a useful medium
between the public and the broker.</p>

<p>There are some dealers on the <i>Stock
Exchange</i>—the mart where stocks and shares
are bought and sold—who, by a poetic figure,
are known as <i>Bulls</i> and <i>Bears</i>. Bulls are
dealers who buying stock low have an interest
in trying all sorts of devices to raise prices.
Bears, on the other hand, try to bring prices
down, they being commonly persons who
have sold and undertaken to deliver more
stock than they are in possession of, and who
are therefore under the necessity of buying in
at a loss in order to settle their accounts.
How they came to be called bulls and bears is
doubtful. “They have been connected,”
says one writer, “with the animals to which
allusion is made by a reference to their
respective modes of attack. The bear
crushes, or bears <i>down</i> his antagonist,
whereas the bull’s method is to toss him <i>up</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Transfer</i> is the legal operation by which
the rights and responsibilities of the people
disposing of stock or shares are conveyed to
those who buy. When the purchaser, or his
or her attorney, signs the transfer in the bank
books, that is known as <i>Acceptance of Stock</i>.</p>

<p>The periodical payments of interest made
by the Government to the holders of the
National Debt and other public funds are
known as <i>Dividends</i>. The term dividend is
also applied to the sums paid to the shareholders
of a company at each periodical
division of profits.</p>

<p><i>Cum-Dividend</i> means that the purchaser
of the shares is to receive the dividend then
payable or about to be paid. That is to say,
the sale is <i>with</i> the dividend.</p>

<p><i>Ex-Dividend</i> just means the reverse; a sale
<i>ex-dividend</i> is <i>without</i> the dividend.</p>

<p><i>Paid-up shares</i> are shares on which the full
subscribed or nominal amount has been paid
up. In the case of a limited liability
company, for example, the shares may be
nominally of £100, with £50 paid-up. Here
the purchaser has to consider that she is
liable at any time to be called on to subscribe
the remaining £50 per share. Should the
company come to grief she will not only lose
what she paid for the shares, but be liable for
£50 as well upon each share.</p>

<p>When the price of securities of any kind is
equal to their nominal value, they are said to
be at <i>par</i>. Suppose £100 shares in a gas
company are selling at £94, they are 6 per
cent. <i>below par</i>; if £103 they are 3 per cent.
<i>above par</i>.</p>

<p>When you see shares quoted as <i>at a
premium</i>—say £1 shares at 5s. <i>premium</i>—that
means that for every share you would
have to pay 25s., or 5s. more than its nominal
value.</p>

<p><i>Debentures</i>, as commonly understood, are
mortgage deeds given by railway companies
in acknowledgment of borrowed money.
Debenture bonds give the holders the first
claim for dividends on the company’s receipts.</p>

<p><i>Preference Shares</i> are shares on which a
dividend is bound to be paid so long as the
net income is sufficient, even though there
should not be a farthing left for the ordinary
shareholders.</p>

<p>A <i>Dividend Warrant</i> is the document
which entitles the holder of stock to receive
payment of her dividend. Dividend warrants
may be lodged with one’s banker in the same
way as cheques.</p>

<p><i>Coupons</i> is a term used for dividend or interest
warrants attached to bonds running for
a fixed number of years. They are usually
printed at the bottom of the bond, there being
one for every period at which interest becomes
due. They must be cut off and presented at
the right time to the appointed banker or
agent. Many coupons require a stamp, which
must be placed at the back, and have the
name of the person to whom the money is due
written across it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe10_9375" id="i366">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i366.jpg" alt="“I" />
</div><p>&nbsp;<span class="uppercase">shan’t</span>, won’t, and
can’t like Uncle
Jasper; it’s quite
impossible, I know,
for me to do it; if
he had any other
name I might
perhaps try; but
Jasper, Jasper, just
fancy liking anyone
with such a name!
He’s quite certain,
with a name like that, to
keep the windows tight shut
in July, and insist on my
wearing a fur cape in April, and eating oatmeal
porridge for breakfast, and no butter and
marmalade; and he’ll be always dressed in a
hideous, flaring red dressing-gown, and he’s
sure to have a wig, and he’ll never take a walk
with me after sunset, because of some horrid
old whim about catching cold. No, it’s not to
be supposed that I can even tolerate Uncle
Jasper; and as for going and living with him,
and leaving our bright, jolly life here, it’s
quite out of the question.”</p>

<p>The speaker was myself. At that time I was
a girl of fourteen, with brown eyes, and little feet
that danced in unison; with a slight figure
which, in its restless activity, brings to my
mind now, as I look back, the ceaseless
motion of the pampas grass when the breeze
touches it ever so softly; with thick, frizzy,
rebellious, dark hair, that utterly refused to
accommodate itself to any known fashion of
hairdressing whatsoever; with a broad,
intelligent brow, which sometimes wrote the
word “wilfulness” much too legibly upon
itself in certain wrinkles and lines, if contradiction
or any kind of supposed indignity
stirred up my spirit within me, as was much
too often the case; with a little red mouth,
which was occasionally much too resolute a
mouth for a young lady who had not travelled
on very far in her teens.</p>

<p>Both my parents had died when I was quite
a little child; they had lived in India, and I
had known very little of their love or care. I
had no near relations in England to take me
under their protection; I had spent my whole
life at school, going for my holidays to the
houses of different schoolfellows. I was the
heiress to a small fortune of my own, which
was managed by an old gentleman in the city
who had been left my guardian, and who
never came to visit me more than twice a year,
when he paid a state call at my school, and
sat with me and the head schoolmistress in
the grand, chill drawing-room—into which no
one ever entered save on the most solemn
occasions—for two terrible hours, inquiring
into my health, my studies, and my expenses,
at the end of which periods I always felt as if
I had been for a voyage at sea on the top of
an iceberg.</p>

<p>Now the one thing wanting in my young
life was love. I was a clever girl, and took
generally a lion’s share of the prizes in the
school for every kind of learning and accomplishment.
I was endowed with a fair proportion
of good looks, and I had quite as much
money allowed me by my guardian as any girl
of my age could reasonably desire. I could not
say that I wished especially for anything which
was not within the reach of my attainment
in the circumstances in which I was placed;
still, I had a vague consciousness that I did
want something, and this something was love.
As has been said, I had no near relations, and
I was not one of those girls who seem to
carry about with them a fairy machine for
manufacturing affection wherever they go. My
religion was at that time more of a dead form
than a living spirit, warming and colouring my
whole life; and thus I was wanting in the
highest power of all for waking and creating
love in those around us.</p>

<p>The two ladies who kept our school and the
under-governesses were all, in a certain way,
proud of me for my cleverness and good looks.
But none of them tried to make their way
into my heart. They were all somewhat indolent
women, and as I did them credit in
their school, they gave me my way far more
than was good for me, and so fostered the
wilfulness which was one of the worst features
of my character. My schoolfellows,
most of them, liked me to a certain extent;
my lively chatter—for I had always a nimble
tongue—made me a pleasant companion and
an agreeable visitor. At the same time, however,
they were all a little afraid of me, on
account of the reputation I had for superior
mental gifts, and not one among them ever
endeavoured to be intimate with me. They
went so far in their acquaintance with me—that
is, as far as a thick rind of proud reserve
which surrounded the inner recesses of
my thoughts and feelings would allow; and
when they reached this point they were content
to remain without the barrier.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way with me till a
new girl, called Lily Greenwood, came to our
school. Lily was not either as clever or as
pretty as I was; but there was a charm about
her which I had not—the charm of a sweet,
sympathetic nature, which the high, pure atmosphere
of a Christian home had developed
early into blossoms of rare beauty. In a
month everyone in the school loved Lily.
Even the girls with the prickliest tempers,
who were always saying “won’t” and
“shan’t,” said “will” and “shall” to Lily;
and the girls with the dullest brains, who
could never be either pulled or driven through
the German declensions, brightened up at her
magic spells, and grew quite starlike in their
gleams and twinkles of intelligence; and the
greedy girls got to share their most cherished
dainties with her, because she set them such
an example of entire, smiling, gracious unselfishness;
and the very cat, who used to spit
and grumble if but the skirts of our dresses
touched her, came to sit on Lily’s knee, and
rejoiced in being stroked by her hand.</p>

<p>Among the rest, I fell gradually under the
witchery practised by Lily. She seemed to
know by instinct that love was what I wanted,
and she came and wove a web of sunbeams
around me, till at length I was caught in
it. I began to open my heart to her,
and to let her come in, as I had never done
to anyone before; and I began, too, to feel
real warm affection for her. Still, I did not
let Lily’s influence work upon me for good as
much as it ought to have done; my pride forbade
it, and I continued in most things my old
wilful self.</p>

<p>Some few months before my story begins
it had been discovered by the doctors that my
chest was delicate, and that it would be beneficial
for my health to spend the winter in a
warmer climate. My guardian, who was always
very eager to atone for his want of
affection for me by most scrupulous care for
my temporal well-being, at once decided that
I should go to the South of France in November,
and remain there till April, and came to
my schoolmistress to arrange with her as to
how the plan could be carried out. It was
settled that Miss Dolly, the younger of our
schoolmistress’s sisters, who kept the school
jointly with her, should occupy, with me,
a villa near Cannes, and that I should
have one companion of my own age to keep
me from being dull. Great was my joy when
I heard that this companion was to be Lily.
She was not very strong, and her father, who
had lately lost his wife (on which account Lily
had been sent to school), thought it a good
opportunity of getting needful change for her
without having to go with her himself, and
leave his business as a merchant for a while.</p>

<p>The plan had proved a great success, as far
as Lily and I were concerned. Our bodily
strength increased in the warm, sweet, southern
air; we learned to talk French like natives;
we rejoiced in long rambles through the vineyards
and among the bands of flowers which
soon began to appear in the land as the fair
vanguard of spring; but it cannot be said
that it was exactly a season of joy and repose
for Miss Dolly.</p>

<p>Miss Dolly was one of the mildest, most
characterless single ladies that ever put on a
cap. When she went into office at the Villa
Chantilly, it was, of course, intended that she
should rule her pupils; but the fable could
not long be kept standing on its feet; it
quickly appeared that her pupils, or at least
one of her pupils, and that one myself, ruled
her entirely. I insisted on all the furniture in
the house making the strangest migrations
from room to room about twenty times in succession,
to suit my fancy; I vexed poor Miss
Dolly’s soul by causing the cooks to give
warning, one after another, because I would
not be satisfied without going down daily into
the kitchen to enter into an exhaustive study
of the way to make omelettes; I made raids
into the garden to gather flowers when I ought
to have been practising my scales; I put on a
bland air of submission when Miss Dolly made
a supreme decree that we were never to be out
after the dew began to fall; and then, while
she slumbered in her armchair (with Rollin’s
History, which she had been reading out loud,
in her lap), coolly stepped out through the
window on to the turf in the moonlight. Lily
endeavoured, it is true, to strengthen Miss
Dolly’s hands as far as she could, but at the
same time I saw, plainly enough that smiles
would now and then, in spite of herself, come
creeping round her mouth as she watched my
proceedings. The result of all this was, as
might be naturally expected, that I grew more
wilful than ever, and fonder of my own way in
everything.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the Villa
Chantilly when, one morning early in March,
there arrived from Miss Dolly’s elder sister in
England a letter which seemed likely to change
the whole course of my future. It told how
there had come to the school a gentleman
making anxious inquiries about me, Beatrice
Warmington, and how this gentleman was my
uncle, Mr. Jasper Rosebury. I had never
heard of such a relation, and at first I simply
refused to believe in his existence. A few
more sentences of the letter, however, proved
most indisputably that Mr. Rosebury had
married my mother’s elder sister, that she had
died young, before my mother was married
herself, and that he had then gone to Australia,
where he had remained ever since. I
had, of course, never even heard his name;
for when my parents were alive I was too
young to understand anything about our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">{367}</span>
family history, and my guardian had probably
never thought it worth while to trouble himself
to make known to me the facts concerning
my aunt’s early marriage and death. Besides,
Jasper Rosebury had not been heard of for
some years, even by his own relations.</p>

<p>The letter, moreover, informed us that my
Uncle Jasper was about to come to the villa,
and take me away from school and all school
authority for good, to live with him. It was
against this plan that I was raising up such
energetic objections. I did not wish to leave
my bright, enjoyable life at the villa; I did
not wish to have an old gentleman, such as
my imagination represented my uncle, for a
constant companion; and, most of all, I did
not wish to be separated from Lily. Besides
all this, I had taken a whimsical but most
resolute dislike to my uncle, simply because
I had a prejudice against his Christian name,
Jasper.</p>

<p>The scene grew more and more disturbed
round the breakfast-table that morning in the
Villa Chantilly. Miss Dolly remonstrated,
coaxed, cried, made a faint attempt at scolding,
and then cried again. As for myself, I
did nothing but repeat over and over a most
flat and unequivocal refusal ever to live with
Uncle Jasper. He would be here to-morrow,
Miss Dolly sobbed. Then let him be here;
that made no difference to me. I would not
go with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Beatrice!” here put in Lily’s sweet,
low voice—she had been making attempts
from time to time to still the storm—“if it
was only my dear mother’s brother, whom she
used to tell me so much about, come back,
how happy—”</p>

<p>But here I broke in upon her with, “I wish,
Lily, that you and Miss Dolly were tied up in
a bag with all the old rusty, musty uncles and
aunts going, then, I should think, you’d
both have a jolly time of it.”</p>

<p>After that I flounced out of the room, banging
the door after me.</p>

<p>It was all very well to flounce and bang,
but I knew well enough in my inmost soul
that no flouncing and banging could change
the fact that Uncle Jasper would be here to-morrow.
I meditated and meditated upon
this certainty, until out of it, and out of my
resolute, headstrong wilfulness, there grew up
a firm determination—I would run away.</p>

2. The worldly rich man, who pampered himself and
showed no mercy to the poor creature who crawled
to his gate for his charity in vain, was popularly
called Dives for lack of a name, which signifies in one
word what he was, <i>i.e.</i>, rich man, the word used in

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Nineteen</span> will find the china sold at Doulton’s,
Mortlock’s, and other well-known firms, the most
satisfactory for painting upon. The faults she
names arise more from the firing and the application
of the colour than the foundation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adah.</span>—Bronze painting materials are sold at most
artist colourmen’s, and are always procurable if not
in stock when required. Each bottle of colour costs
from sixpence to a shilling, and the price of a bracket
depends on the number of colours used.</p>

<p>S. K. C.—The best apparatus for setting crayon
drawings is called Rouget’s fixative. A thin spray of
the fixative is dispersed over the surface of the completed
work in the same way that scent is thrown
about a room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span>—1. A crayon copy is not eligible for exhibition at
the Royal Academy. 2. A little ammonia will clean
gilt picture frames and restore their brightness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perseverance.</span>—With regard to the circular you have
enclosed to us, it appears to be the same as many
others which we have seen, and we should recommend
caution regarding it. Many ladies have spent
money and time over similar advertisements, and have
got nothing by so doing.</p>

<p>P. Z.—Pencil drawings are set by milk and water being
poured over their surfaces. The milk used is skim
milk largely diluted by water. A dinner dish or
large tray is used in which to immerse the drawing
by some people; others pour the water over them,
and hang the drawings over the back of a wooden
chair to drip dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Olive.</span>—To cover table-tops with Christmas
cards, the wood should be first sized with strong
size, and when dry the cards affixed to the surface
with strong gum. Then re-size and varnish with
white hard varnish. The cards should be arranged
on the table first with pins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinder Gartner.</span>—We think that you might extract
the grease stains from the paper by covering it with
blotting-paper and holding a hot flat-iron near it.
But you must do it gradually and watchfully, or you
may curl up the tinted paper. You had better lay
the blotting-paper at the back of the embossing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wainwright.</span>—In former times surnames were
variously spelt by members of the same families
owning them. That of the famous Flemish painter,
Sir Anthony Vandyck, or Vandyke, is an exemplification
of this fact. In Benjamin Vincent’s “Dictionary
of Biography,” in Gorton’s “Biographical
Dictionary,” the “Student’s Encyclopædia,” and in
Phillip’s “Dictionary of Biographical Reference,”
Sir Anthony’s name is spelt with a “c”. So also is
that of Daniel Vandyck, a French painter of the
seventeenth century, and Philippus Vandyck, a
Dutch painter, 1680-1752. A good connoisseur would
be able to tell you to which of these masters your
picture may be attributed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ashe Ingen Court.</span>—Rosenburg’s “Guide to Flower
Painting,” published by Rowney, is a good shilling

<h3>HOUSEKEEPING.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>A. W.—Cocoa is made from the nibs in a tin-pot like a
coffee-pot. Put in half a teacupful each morning,
fill the pot with cold water, and keep it on the stove
all day, so that the goodness may stew out of the
nibs. Use it at breakfast, or when required, each
day, and when empty fill as directed, leaving each
day’s cocoa nibs in the pot till the end of the week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rale Cearney.</span>—The cheese course comes before the

<p><span class="smcap">Yarmouth Bloater.</span>—1. Steaming is considered the
best way of cleaning feathers, but in the country,
where they must be done at home, they should be
put into warm water, to which should be added a
little soda or chloride of lime. After this wash they
are rinsed in cold water and put to dry on a clean
cloth. If dried in a stove, they must be put into
bags of clean muslin, and placed in the oven with the
door open till the drying is complete and they are
fit for use. We are sorry to hear you do not lend the
volumes of the G.O.P. even to your sisters; it
seems like an old story many times read and told,
but not often taken to heart—the talents laid carefully

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>M. S. K.—You must make your own choice; we could
not lay down any dogmatic rule as to the merits of
one Christian community over another. God had an
elect people in the Israelites, and to those who did
not live up to the Divine privileges they enjoyed, our
Lord said it would be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for them.
God has, in His wisdom and goodness, elected you
into some division of the Christian Church—His fold
on earth—which is composed of many communities
(united on the main though differing respectively on
the minor doctrines of the Christian faith). You
might have been born a Jew, heathen, Mahommedan,
Red Indian, or of any other parentage outside the
pale of His fold, but you were elected to enjoy special
privileges, a knowledge of Divine truth, and all the
precious means of grace. Under such circumstances,
if you be not devout, your judgment will be the
more severe; for, like Esau, you will have thrown
away your birthright, and thus your blessing, for you
are a responsible being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie Mary.</span>—We sympathise much with you in
the sentiments you express, and the experiences you
have had, and we quite agree with you that prayer,
offered in faith in the special divine promises to which
you refer, will do more for the sick than any human
means. Have recourse to the former, and have
nothing to do with mesmerism. If you write again,
give your address.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary L. Saunders</span> is thanked for informing us of
the institution of a school at Haldon View, Topsham,
Devon, for children of weak intellect. We are
gratified to hear that a suggestion of ours caused
the carrying out of this charitable plan. The premises
are excellent, and there is accommodation for
eight pupils. The promoters of the scheme are
sisters of the writer, and have a licence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwendolin Marzipan.</span>—The Odd Minutes Society
might suit you; sec., Miss Powell, Luctons, Buckhurst-hill,
Essex. The particulars will be sent you
in print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shirley.</span>—See <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65406/65406-h/65406-h.htm#Page_192">page 192</a>, Part for January. A
man’s money does not go to any brother or sister
should he die intestate and leave a widow or
children. In the latter case the widow has a third of
his property, and the rest is divided equally between
his children. Should he die leaving only one child,
the widow still has her third and the one child
(whether son or daughter) inherits all the rest—that
is, two-thirds. His brothers and sisters cannot claim
a farthing when he leaves a widow and child, excepting
by will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivy Leaf.</span>—James Mason has given a series of articles
on the subject of your letter—“Every Girl a Business
Woman,” beginning in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65752/65752-h/65752-h.htm#EVERY_GIRL_A_BUSINESS_WOMAN">vol. viii., p. 118</a>. No stamp
was necessary on the I.O.U. given you as a receipt
for your £30 loan to some man. How disgraceful on
the part of one of his sex to borrow such a sum of a
girl, and require to be sued for its recovery!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Careless One.</span>—Refer to our indexes for our instructions
entitled “How to Remove Inkstains from
Ivory,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Tom.</span>—1. The girl you name as being hopelessly
attached to a man she has never met but only seen at
concerts, should be sent away from the foreign town
where you both are staying, either to a friend’s house
and care or to a good school. The story is of a most
humiliating character; she disgraces the sex, the
members of which should be sought, not themselves
the seekers. Certainly you should not make any
such revelations and overtures to a stranger. If she
have no self-respect herself, her friends should not
betray such a deplorable state of things. It would
be like dragging her through the gutter. 2. We could
not hazard an opinion on what was your disease.
Your writing slopes the wrong way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perplexed.</span>—Go to receive the Holy Communion in
charity with all, in humility and repentance, with a
steadfast resolution, by the help of the Holy Spirit,
to amend your life and cherish no wilful sin, nor any
omission of duty. Confess your utter unworthiness
and accept Christ as your only hope. Thus you will
not present yourself unworthily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yum-yum</span> wishes to obtain the publication of a story
which she has written. We cannot altogether comply,
but give an extract. A young man was given over
in decline, induced by the refusal of his suit to a girl
called Gwendolyne. But the latter being hungry
one day, “Alexander took her to an eating house, and
treated her to a sausage, and then, indeed, gratitude
won the day, for Gwendolyne leaned her head on
Alexander’s shoulder, and she was his.” We cannot
undertake to insert Yum-yum’s nor Gwendolyne’s
photographs in the G.O.P. in return for her story, as
desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One Perplexed</span> has jilted her intended husband after
some years’ engagement, and this without giving him
the full explanation he had a right to demand. She
has left him, moreover, for a whole year without one
word of such explanation. There is so great a
diversity in opinion amongst religious, God-fearing
people as to a sincere Christian’s liberty (in such
matters as that which has led her to cast off her
intended) that we consider her conduct the more
reprehensible.</p>

<p>M. E. B. (Charnwood).—Apply to our publisher. The
Editor has nothing to do with his department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maritzburg.</span>—Write to Miss E. Faithfull, who conducts
the Institution for female emigration in Manchester,
10, Albert-square (Scottish Insurance
Buildings). State your case, and we think the
matter might be arranged for you, if you said any
opening was ready for you.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Abitur of the Hills.</span>—The name cayenne is French,
and should be pronounced kay-en.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violet.</span>—We do not enter into nor discuss subjects of
the kind about which you inquire. If your parents
really object to your receiving the Holy Communion
oftener than once a month, why should you cross
their wishes? You would show good feeling in consulting
them on all occasions short of an infringement
of a positive duty, and no divine command prescribes
the frequency of your availing yourself of this
spiritual privilege.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivy.</span>—Were you of full age, it would still be your duty
to please and requite your parents, and to stretch
a great point so to do; but as a mere minor of
eighteen, it is an act of rebellion on your part to
keep company and flirt with any man. The next
time he presumes to address you, say he can do so
no more, as your parents object to it, and then walk
resolutely away. As he is above you in position,
your parents are wise in their view of the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Investor</span> is reading, we hope, Mr. James Mason’s
articles on business for women, in the present numbers
of the G.O.P. We do not know anything of
the company you mention, and should advise you to
write and make inquiries from them; and we also
recommend you to divide what money you have, to
avoid having “all your eggs in the same basket.”
Put £50 each into two things, for instance. Is there
not some old and respectable building society where
you live that you could inquire about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma Hay.</span>—1. The 23rd April, 1865, was a Saturday.
2. Your writing might be improved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethild Mya B.</span>—We do not know what to suggest,
save to teach knitting to all your little class, and
then get them some clothing for poor children to
make. Boys are taught both plain sewing and
knitting in Board schools now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kathleen.</span>—The quotation, “They also serve who
only stand and wait,” is from Milton’s poem on his
blindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Rose L.</span>—1. The numbers are sixpence each. Six
would be 3s., and the parcels post about 6d. 2. The
23rd of January, 1863, was a Friday. The word
“truly” does not need an “e” in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Synge.</span>—We are much obliged for your letter and its
quotation, which we know well. We do not suppose
that the writer intended more than half a truth in
what he said, probably in allusion to the single
watch-notes of the robin. In the limits of a short
article it is not possible to go into many particulars.
We know many people who never heard a robin sing,
as his tones in the spring and summer are always
drowned in the general chorus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lilian</span> has our sincere sympathy on the three accounts
named. May she find rest in the knowledge of that
“Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.” We
regret that she gave no address. Has Lilian a movable
desk to accommodate to her convenience as she
reclines? If so, she might sometimes prepare scrap-books
for hospitals, with every sort of picture and
card. Such books are made very entertaining both
to the maker and the receiver by decapitating figures
and making an exchange of heads, especially in the
case of old photographs; also in introducing figures
into landscapes and interiors. Such books are a real
boon to sufferers in hospitals.</p>

<p>S. E. P.—You seem to need a tonic. As your general
health must be weak, perhaps some cod-liver oil
would answer. Keep your feet dry and warm, and
wear flannels next the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gingerbottle.</span>—1. Handel, the composer, was buried
in Westminster Abbey. 2. The best thing to do about
colds, we think, is not to catch them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hopeful Yum-Yum.</span>—You should say, “None of us
have,” and “Neither of us is.” We regret that your
letter was not answered before.</p>

<p>E. O.—1. The 17th February, 1862, was a Monday.
2. The tale of “Only a Girl-Wife” was begun in the
G.O.P. for October 3rd, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel.</span>—The Editor regrets to decline Isabel’s poem,
but is much obliged for her good opinion of the
G.O.P.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eileen.</span>—Is the poem meant for blank verse? If so,
it is incorrect in its construction, and many of the
expressions used are very unpoetical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Greenwood.</span>—The lines you send us are fairly
correct, and show cleverness and a certain facility in
writing. With practice you ought to do much
better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annie Maggs.</span>—Water for drinking should always be
filtered; but the impurities in it would vary in
different localities. In some they would arise from
decayed vegetation. Boiled water is the safest to
drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud Morley.</span>—A vamper means one who vamps, or
pieces an old thing with something new. It is not
always applied to shoes and boots, for in some parts
of England “to vamp” means to bully or bluster,
and in others it means to travel, while in Swift’s
writings we find the sentence, “I never had much
hopes of your <i>vamped-up</i> play.”</p>

<p>R. M. A. and Others.—1. None of the handwritings are
pretty, but all distinct and easy to read. 2. Sir John
Lubbock’s “Best Hundred Books” would serve as
a guide; also two very good articles in the <i>Leisure
Hour</i> of last year, on the same subject, would contain
all the information needful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Irene Dale</span> had better send for our paper-pattern
of “a bodice to take the place of stays,”
which she will see advertised in the monthly list
given at the end of every article on “Dress: in
Season and in Reason,” by the “Lady Dressmaker.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. Wales.</span>—We recommend you to have nothing to do
with the description of experiments to which you
refer. As our magazine is not a medium for any
kind of controversy, we do not name the subject to
which you refer; but we may tell you that we highly
disapprove of them. We are glad that your father
and brothers like our magazine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goody Two-Shoes.</span>—1. We think you must have made
a mistake, and that your bad dreams were the results
of your suppers, not of your abstinence from them.
As a rule, they are by no means wholesome. The
digestive powers are weary after their due work of
the day, just as your legs and your brain. They
should not be taxed when they need repose. If set
to work when tired, the work is only half done, and
headaches and blotches in the face, as well as unpleasant
dreams, may be expected. A biscuit and a cup of
milk might be excepted from this charge, and, possibly,
be even desirable. 2. The 16th of August, 1865,
was a Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Wright</span> (New South Wales).—Your kind letter
was very gratifying to us, and we heartily wish you
the same blessings that you desire for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Iris.</span>—1. We thank you for the recipe for preserving
flowers in a vase—<i>i.e.</i>, to put a good pinch of salt in
the water, and more if the vase be large. It counteracts
the bad effect produced by a hot room. If your
mother-in-law be kindly disposed towards you, as
evidenced by subscribing herself “affectionately,”
and even “very affectionately yours,” you may sign
yourself “your affectionate daughter.” 2. The operation,
as performed in the sad case you describe, is
indeed most horrible. Happily, all cases and all
modes of treatment are not alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beryl.</span>—You need complete change of air. If living
inland, go to the seaside; if on a plain, exchange
to an elevated situation. If this change be accompanied
by a complete rest from intellectual work,
and from use of the eyes in reading, writing, or fine
needlework; and, added to this, you go out twice a
day, abstaining from walks that will fatigue you, and
you take cod-liver oil or plenty of cream, we think
you will recover in a few months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vizer.</span>—Friction is good for the liver, not “blows.”
The use of a skipping-rope is desirable, and brown
wholemeal bread should be taken for breakfast and
tea—not mere ordinary bread with an admixture of
bran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flake.</span>—Hot potatoes and hot carrots are very wholesome;
not so when cold. Your digestion appears out of
order. Consult a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tring.</span>—Perhaps tannin lozenges and alum and water
gargle might be serviceable to you; but we cannot
prescribe for perfect strangers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Little Lamb.</span>—We sympathise much with you in
the religious sentiments you express, and we wish
you God-speed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puzzled One.</span>—The word “glebe” has more than
one meaning. Webster gives four. It is derived
from the Latin—<i>Gleba</i>, clod, land, soil. In mining
it means a piece of earth containing mineral ore; in
ecclesiastical law it means the land belonging to as
parish church or benefice. It was used to mean a
meadow or field in your quotation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two Fern Leaves</span> have no business to correspond
with any young men without their parents’ express
sanction, and unless engaged to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juno.</span>—Certainly, women can sign as witnesses to a
will or any legal document, provided they be of
age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Brooks.</span>—We could not possibly tell you what
salary you might obtain at a fancy-work shop, as so
much depends on the style of place, situation, facility
in obtaining hands, state of trade, and amount of
competition in that line of business, added to which
must be your own efficiency and experience. Inquire
at several shops, and so discover the average salary
given.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
